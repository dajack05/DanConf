# Daniel's Lame Configurations

After much weeping and gnashing of teeth, I've managed to find some configurations I like. So I thought I'd write them down and see if I still like them next time I need them.

With a little luck, this repo will grow as I use it more, but for now it will include the following:

- [tmux](./tmux/Readme.md)
    - Splitting command rebind to | and - to split.
    - Default Mouse Mode On.
    - Allows Alt-[Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Up Arrow, Down Arrow] to switch panes.
- [nvim](./nvim/Readme.md)
    - Full support for Rust.
        - Rust-Analyzer.

But more will be added in time.

Thanks!

Enjoy!
